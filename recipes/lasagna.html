    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Season ground beef with garlic powder. Heat a large skillet over
        medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until
        browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour spaghetti sauce, tomato sauce, and oregano into a large saucepan.
        Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute garlic
        and onions until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Place cooked
        onion-garlic mixture and cooked ground beef into the sauce mixture.
        Cover and let simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine mozzarella and provolone cheeses in a medium bowl. Mix ricotta
        cheese, eggs, milk, and 1/2 teaspoon oregano together in a separate
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer a 9x13-inch baking pan with just enough sauce to cover the bottom
        of the pan. Lay three lasagna noodles in the pan over the sauce. Cover
        with more sauce, then with ricotta mixture then sprinkle with
        mozzarella/provolone mixture; repeat layering. Finish with a layer of
        noodles and remaining sauce. Sprinkle top with Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake, covered, in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Uncover and
        continue to bake until cheese is melted and top is golden, about 15
        minutes more.
      </li>
    </ol>
